While learning how to become a software engineer through any avenue is challenging, I would argue that an online learning environment is extremely valuable for many students today. Though I would advocate for an in-person learning setting for most educational programs, I firmly believe that the nature of learning to code is best suited for an online atmosphere.

Due to the vast amount of resources for learning full-stack web development on the web, very few questions remain unanswered once you tap into the larger software development community. While having the opportunity to learn how to code within a physical class setting is helpful for holding one accountable and providing structure, the online environment gives the student infinitely more freedom in their learning process to seek answers on the web that lie beyond the scope of their program. Furthermore, what better of a challenge could there be during this time than to obtain all of your information via the very systems that you are studying? Although it may be easier to get lost in times of confusion, developing the ability to navigate oneself through technical challenges is priceless.

Beyond the resources available and the convenience of studying web development via the web, learning software engineering online only strengthens your desire to seek new information at all times, should you remain self-motivated. As an aspiring software engineer who just so happens to be strictly online, anything is possible when it comes to the development of your technical skills; however, only you can decide the true value of your learning experience.
