Transitioning from creating an application solely using one repository to two can be intimidating, though it gives the developer the opportunity to gain a better understanding of the ways in which both JavaScript and a Rails API operate. Previously, one was able to remain complacent in the "magic" of Rails; however, incorporating a JavaScript front-end requires the developer to firmly grasp what is being passed from the server to the client via JSON. 

While the Rails back-end is written nearly identically to the Ruby on Rails project, the JavaScript front-end incorporates countless new abilities that can add challenges to expanding off of a previously developed web application. Consequently, it can be humbling to slim down the operation of a project to accomodate overcoming these challenges. On the other hand, taking a step back to further comprehend the process of a JavaScript front-end will allow one to more effectively utilize its capabilities moving forward. From watching the application work from the back-end to the front-end within the adapter, component, and html files, experiencing the flow of an application paints a much more realistic representation of how programs interact within themselves and APIs.

Despite the initial challenges of incorporating JavaScript, it is a valuable step as it opens many doors in the functionality of potential code to come. Moving forward with a better understanding of JavaScript and APIs, I am excited to take bigger steps towards better utilizing the vast capabilities of this dynamic front-end language!
