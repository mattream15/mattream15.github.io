In today's world, it has become commonplace for people to be working in a field that differs from their college degree. With a strong science background, I never thought that would be the case for me in my life. However, after graduating college with a B.S. in Biochemistry, I realized how little interest I have in practicing chemical reactions. Though I am still quite interested in life sciences, I now know I want to tap into another side of the industry for my future career. I want to be able to incorporate my scientific thought process as well as my creativity and interest in maximizing operatioal efficiency. Thanks to my minor in Business Administration, I was able to gain some amount of experience through internships that helped shape my curiousity towards developing an understanding of software in its entirety.

I was first exposed to software development while interning for a cloud-based, outsourced IT company. My task at this company was largely to detect bugs on the surface within a new application so that the necessary changes could be made to bring the product to the market. Though my role was hardly technical, I was amazed by the code's influence on the desired operation. On the other side of software, during a pair of human resources internships, I poured my days into mindlessly navigating a variety of web applications in order to complete my duties. During this time period, I couldn't help but wonder what could make these processes more efficient in order to save time, money, and resources. As graduation came, I decided to take the opportunity to transition to a career in software engineering because I valued the possible impact that it could have for businesses and was determined to be a part of the technical curve that will lead society tomorrow.

Though I have prepared myself with an open-mind while studying software engineering through Flatiron School, I would like to incorporate my newly developed skills into the STEM industry with a broader understanding of business through an MBA program post-graduation. With much to be learned about software and the role it can play in operations, I am excited to master the skill of coding!
