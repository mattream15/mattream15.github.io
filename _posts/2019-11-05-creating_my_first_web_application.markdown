In a time where technology nearly controls every aspect of our lives, we are constantly flooded with web pages of all shapes and sizes. As one prepares to develop their first web application, failure is inevitable if you let yourself compare your work to that which you see everyday around you. While it is important to have a source for inspiration or wonder, it is essential to be patient to give your developing abilities the time to grow. Allowing yourself to code with an open-mind will give you the opportunity to pull many more valuable lessons from this new experience, and you may even surprise yourself with what you are able to create!
