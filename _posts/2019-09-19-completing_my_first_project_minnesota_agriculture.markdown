As I progressed through the first portion of Flatiron's Software Engineering program, I oftentimes found myself frustrated with my coding as I continuously failed to properly implement Ruby within the labs that we were assigned. Despite feeling confident in my ability to learn new information, I faced syntax error after syntax error, later finding that I wrote way more code than was necessary. However, these struggles provided me with the perfect environment to soak up as much practical application from technical coaches and my cohort lead while I sought guidance in assimilating this foreign language into my brain. Furthermore, it gave me a lot to look forward to as the project neared, as I firmly believed that it would only further solidify my understanding of Ruby and programming as a whole. Besides, things could only get better, right?

The first project required the student to produce a gem in whatever context that they would like, so long as it pulled from a scrapable website and was a Command Line Interface (CLI) that utilized Object Oriented Ruby. With an interest in life sciences, I chose to develop a gem that would allow a user to navigate through a table of data regarding Minnesota's agriculture in 2018. The website that I used was organized by crop and listed a series of quantitative measurements for each crop's production in that year. It was my goal to provide a user with a summary of each crop's production during that setting in an efficient mannner.

Though the project appeared to be quite intimidating at times, from a confusing setup to errors connecting to multiple files, it was crucial to my growth towards becoming a software engineer. The process helped me develop the skill of working through challenging errors that I had never seen before, in addition to painting a clearer picture of the code that I write. While each language and project may bring on new, tougher challenges, I am eager to see them through as they feed my capability of producing solid programs!
