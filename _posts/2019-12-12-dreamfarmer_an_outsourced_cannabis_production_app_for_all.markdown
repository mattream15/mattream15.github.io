In a time when cannabis production policy and practice is rapidly growing, I sought to create an innovative environment within the cannabis industry that would allow users to produce the harvests of their dreams. With DreamFarmer, users customize their plants' growth process from growing method to light source, and much more, in order to meet all of their production goals.

Though using a heavier web framework such as Ruby on Rails brought on some challenges, it also created plenty of opportunity in the app's development. While the project was merely a simulation for how the potential business may operate someday, it introduced several key features that will pave the way for new processes to be developed in future. First, DreamFarmer harvests cannabis plants using a random number generator within a particular range, taking into account how many seeds a particular user has selected. Additionally, using a scope method, DreamFarmer sorts all of the harvests within its system by the weight of the cannabis plants flowers. Lastly, DreamFarmer introduced a market that allows users to sell a given amount of their harvest. With these additions in place, DreamFarmer aims to expand its user experience to allow multiple users to buy and sell portions of their harvest. With this feature in the works, the primary objective is to produce a cannabis production network for companies to better utilize the cannabis plants that they harvest.

From seed to sale, DreamFarmer puts its users first in every step of its production cycle. With the cannabis industry booming from sea to shining sea, DreamFarmer has its roots planted in providing its users with the ultimate cannabis production experience for all!
